# comments-webApp


Few point to consider before running it to server:
- Please, use npm install both for frontend part and backend part before writing the command npm start.
- After that, please write npm start to run the front end part(for starting reactjs server).
- Open another command line and run node server.js to connect the server side as well as database(mongodb is used as a database).


- After the server starts and project is deployed, please signup first, while signing in, for the new user it will directly log him/her but from next time they have to login again.
- Open the site on two different tabs, same project in each tabs with different users inorder to experience the change in comments when someone adds new comments from his/her account. 

Thank You!!!
