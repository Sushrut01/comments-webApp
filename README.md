Few point to consider before running it to server:
- Please, use npm install both for frontend part and backend part before writing the command npm start.
- After that, please write npm start to run the front end part(for starting react server).
- Open another, command line and run node server.js to connect the server side as well as database(mongodb is used as a database).

Thank You!!!
